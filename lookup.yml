# This file contains Key -> Value map.
# Key is representing alias to your binary's relative or absolute path specified in Value.
# Note: relative path is treated from the root of ds-course repository.
#
#
# For example:
# mytask1: ./mytask1/some_folder1/some_folder2/bin_file_to_run
#
# This map is used by build system to run targets as follows:
# make run-model mytask1

task0: ./task0/bin
